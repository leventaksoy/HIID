This repository includes the logic locking tool HIID, which can lock an original design in bench or Verilog using well-known logic locking techniques, such as Anti-SAT, SARLock, TTLock, CAC, and compound logic locking techniques with RLL. It also includes CAC 2.0, which is the improved version of CAC, resilient to existing attacks. Its details are given in its README file.
