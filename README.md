This repository includes the logic locking tool, which can lock an original design in bench or Verilog using well-known logic locking techniques, such as Anti-SAT, SARLock, TTLock, CAC, and compound logic locking techniques with RLL. It also includes CAC 2.0, which is resilient to existing SAT-based, removal, and structural analysis attacks. Its details are given in its README file.
